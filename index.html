            <p>ROOTs Technology is a community curated by people of color, for people of color who want to learn the basics of web development.</p>
            <p>
              "You can't be what you can't see," and for so long, Black and Brown people have been underrepresented in the tech industry, which is why ROOTs Technology is dedicated to mentoring its students with other professionals of color that work in the technology industry, helping change the narrative of under-representation in software development.
            </p>
            <h3 class="ui header">What We Do</h3>
            <p>Students will be given a self-paced curriculum to follow, and are assigned a mentor that they're required to work on a project with three times a week, for an hour.</p>
            <p>
              This ensures that the student is staying on track, and has a mentor avaiable to ask questions to.

        </h4>
        <h3 class="ui header">How much is the course?</h3>
        <p>The course is absolutely FREE! All you need is access to a laptop with a video camera, and internet access.</p>
        <h3 class="ui header">What programming languages will I learn?</h3>

        </p>

        <h3 class="ui header">How does the program work?</h3>
        <p>
          Once admitted into the program, you will be assigned a mentor that you're responsible for setting up Google Hangout sessions with three times a week for an hour. During your scheduled session with your mentor, you will work on a pre-determined project or exercise set. On your own time though, you're expected to be working on the self-paced curriculum provided you. The mentor session will also be used to gauge your progress.
        </p>

        <h3 class="ui header">Who is your target audience?</h3>
        <p>
          Our primary focus is on underrepesented racial minorities in the technology industry, Hispanics and African-Americans. </p>
        <h3 class="ui header">When does the program start? When does it end?</h3>
        <p>
          The program starts as soon as we find a mentor to assign to you, and it ends when you and your mentor have finished all the assigned projects and exercises. Note: you're free to leave the program at any time. Also, any students that miss more than three mentor sessions, and/or are not keeping up with the curriculum, will be asked to leave the program.
