    <h3> About Us </h3>
     <p>ROOTs Technology is a community curated by people of color, for people of color in the Austin area who want to learn the basics of web development. </p>
     <p> As Austin grows as a technology hub and draws more tech companies to the city, it&#8217;s imperative that people of color have a space in the industry.
      Since Austin&#8217;s rising general population contrasts sharply with its declining Black population,
      ROOTs Technology aims to invest in the future of people of color in the tech industry and in Austin. </p>
      <p> ROOTs Technology provides space for people of color to learn the basics of web development through free weekly classes. In addition to gaining hands-on experience and practice,
        students will learn more about the technology industry from an array of mentors, speakers, and scheduled field trips to technology companies in the Austin area.</p>
      <p> "You can&#8217;t be what you can&#8217;t see," and for so long, Black and Brown people have been underrepresented in the tech industry,
          which is why ROOTs Technology is dedicated to surrounding its students with professionals of color that work in the technology industry, helping change the narrative of under-representation. </p>
