              I'm having a great experience with ROOTs so far. They teach you exactly what you'll need to know to become a developer, so you're not wasting time trying to figure out what you need to learn. I was jumping around multiple websites and tutorials trying to figure out what the best path to take, and this has saved me so much time. Having someone there to guide you is incredibly helpful too.

              I'm so happy that I started this journey on becoming a developer. The best investment I've made so far to be honest. I had no knowledge of web development and within a couple weeks I've learned so much about the basics of HTML/CSS. My mentor Tj is always available to take the time and guide me through any questions or problems that I have pertaining to the curriculum. To anyone who is reluctant or afraid to make the leap, just go for it...it is definitely worth it.

            <h4>What will I learn in this curriculum?</h4>
            <p>
              You'll learn to build websites and web applications using the latest and most relevant technologies on the job market, such as JavaScript and React JS, along with Python and Django, giving you the skills necessary to be hired as a software developer/engineer. 
            </p>

            <h4>How long does the curriculum take to finish?</h4>
            <p>
              This is a self-paced curriculum, allowing each student to work at their own pace. We estimate it should take students about three months to finish the frontend React JS portion of the curriculum, at which point they can start applying to jobs. And after that, an additional two months to finish the backend Python portion of the curriculum. So, about five months total to finish the full curriculum.
            </p>

            <i class="bx bx-help-circle"></i>
            <h4>What type of jobs will I be able to apply to when I finish this curriculum?</h4>
            <p>
              Upon completion of the React JS portion of the curriculum, you can start applying to job titles such as: frontend developer, web developer, software developer, and software engineering roles that focus on the frontend. After completing the Python portion, you can start applying to jobs titled: fullstack software developer, software engineer, and Python developer roles. Having Python under your tool belt gives you another option to start pursing data analyst roles as well.

            <p>
              Yes, on top of making sure you have ample projects for your coding portfolio, I will also be providing help in your job search by giving you resources to update your resume, helping you create a cover letter template, and giving you my strategies and tips around sending effective job applications and improving the chance of your applications being seen by a hiring manager. I will also occassionally send a few job postings your way, and try to connect you with recruiters.

            <h4>How long does it take to usually land a job as a junior engineer?</h4>
            <p>
              From my personal experience, and from other observing other self-taught engineers, it takes an average of 3-6 months to land your first engineering job. But, after you land your first engineering job, recruiters chase you instead of the other way around.

            <h4>What happens if I get stuck and need help?</h4>
            <p>
              Depending on the package you purchase, you're alloted a certain number of session hours to schedule tutoring sessions with me over video, where we work on the problem you're stuck on together. This will also be a time for me to review your code and provide you feedback on how to improve, and recommend strategies to help you write better code.

            <h4>Do you offer mock interviews?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes, depending on the package you purchase, you will receive one or two mock interviews where I will be helping you practice for real interviews. I've interviewed a number of software engineering candidates, so I'll be helping you prepare before the mock interview, as well as providing feedback after the mock interview.

            <h4>Is there another way to get help outside of scheduling sessions?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes, you will have access to the private Facebook group of current students in the program with you. Since everyone is working at their own pace, some students will be ahead of you and will be able to help you solve various problems and discuss technical topics you may need more clarity on.

            <p>
              You have access to the coding curriculum and Facebook group of current students for one year. After that, we can discuss any additonal access that you might need on a month-to-month basis.

            <h4>What is a career discovery session?</h4>
            <p>
              A career discovery session is the first step in the Career Prep part of the program. After you've completed the coding section, we assess your likes and dislikes as it relates to programming, and provide recommendations on roles you should consider applying for, types of companies you should look for, and how to assess the companies you're interviewing with to make sure they're a good fit for you.

            <h4>Is this an accredited program?</h4>
            <p>
              No, only colleges and universities are accredited. Coding programs and bootcamps don't receive accreditation, but don't let that deter you from pursuing these alternative routes because most software engineers do not have a computer science degree, but are self-taught. When companies are hiring software engineers, your project portfolio of coding projects is what's considered, along with how you do on the coding questions and challenges they give you in the technical interview process. So, even if you have a computer science degree, you still do the same interview process as someone without it.

            <h4>Is your class designated to help one get a software engineering position?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes, the goal of the ROOTs Technology Coding & Career Prep Program is to teach you to build websites and web applications using JavaScript and Python, and help you prepare for a career change into a web development role.

            <h4>How do you help your students get a job as a software engineer?</h4>
            <p>
              We help our students get jobs as software engineers by helping them prepare for the job search. We do this by working with them to update their resume, helping them create a cover letter template, giving them real-world coding challenges and projects to work on, and conducting mock interviews (package-based) to help them practice for the technical interview process.

            <h4>How long are tutoring sessions?</h4>
            <p>
              A tutoring session is an hour long, but they're scheduled in 30 minute increments. So, a <strong>full</strong> session is an hour long, but you schedule sessions 30 minutes at a time by default, helping you extend the number of actual sessions we have together.
